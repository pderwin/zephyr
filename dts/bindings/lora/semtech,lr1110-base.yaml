        Antenna power enable pin.

    tx-enable-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      required: false
      description: |
        Antenna switch TX enable GPIO. If set, the driver tracks the
        state of the radio and controls the RF switch.

    rx-enable-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      required: false
      description: |
        Antenna switch RX enable GPIO. If set, the driver tracks the

    dio9-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      required: true
      description: |
        GPIO connected to DIO9. This GPIO will be used as a generic
        IRQ line from the chip.

    dio2-tx-enable:
      type: boolean
      required: false
      description: |
        Use DIO2 to drive an RF switch selecting between the TX and RX

        transmitting.

    dio3-tcxo-voltage:
      type: int
      required: false
      description: |
        TCXO supply voltage controlled by DIO3 if present.
